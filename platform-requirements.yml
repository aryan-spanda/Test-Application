# =====================================================================
# NOTE: Application runtime configuration (replicas, image tags, CPU,
# memory, environment variables, etc.) is managed in the Helm chart's
# values files at deploy/helm/, NOT here.

# =====================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION (PLATFORM MANAGED - DO NOT EDIT)
# =====================================================================
# The following resource allocations are managed by the platform team
# and cannot be modified by application developers. These are provided
# for informational purposes only.

# STAGING Environment Resources:
# frontend:
#   replicas: 1 (fixed)
#   resources:
#     cpu: "100m" (platform managed)
#     memory: "128Mi" (platform managed)
# backend:
#   replicas: 1 (fixed)
#   resources:
#     cpu: "200m" (platform managed)
#     memory: "256Mi" (platform managed)
# modules:
#   cdn: false (disabled in staging)
#   waf: false (disabled in staging)
#   backup: false (disabled in staging)
#   disaster_recovery: false (disabled in staging)

# PRODUCTION Environment Resources:
# frontend:
#   replicas: 3 (fixed)
#   resources:
#     cpu: "500m" (platform managed)
#     memory: "512Mi" (platform managed)
# backend:
#   replicas: 3 (fixed)
#   resources:
#     cpu: "1000m" (platform managed)
#     memory: "1Gi" (platform managed)
# modules:
#   waf: true (automatically enabled in production)
#   backup: true (automatically enabled in production)
#   monitoring: true (automatically enabled in production)
#   compliance_scanning: true (automatically enabled in production)

# =====================================================================
# RESOURCE SCALING REQUESTS
# =====================================================================
# If your application requires different resource allocations than the
# standard platform defaults shown above, please contact the platform
# team with:
# 1. Business justification for resource changes
# 2. Performance testing data supporting the request
# 3. Expected traffic/load patterns
# 
# Standard resource tiers available:
# - Small:  frontend(100m/128Mi), backend(200m/256Mi) - 1 replica
# - Medium: frontend(500m/512Mi), backend(1000m/1Gi) - 3 replicas  
# - Large:  Contact platform team for custom sizing
